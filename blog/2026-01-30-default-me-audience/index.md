In an effort to reduce friction when first joining Notifox, we've added a new default audience called `me`. This audience is created on the first sign-in and has the email you've signed up with pre-configured and verified.

That means we've cut out the hassle of having to:
1. Create an audience
2. Enter your email
3. Wait for the 6 digit code to arrive
4. Copy the code into the Notifox verification modal

This should hopefully speed up the process of onboarding even more!

If you would like to use the `me` audience to also send SMS alerts, you can do so by adding and verifying a phone number as you would normally.

If you have signed up before today (January 30th of 2026), fear not! You can create your own `me` audience in the Audiences tab in the [console](https://console.notifox.com). The `me` audience is **not** a protected/reserved audience name, meaning you can delete and re-create the `me` audience as you please. Do note that if you delete the audience, you will have to manually re-verify the email.
