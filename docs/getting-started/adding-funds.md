# Adding Funds

Before you can send alerts, you'll need to add funds to your Notifox account. Your balance is used to pay for alerts:

| Channel | Cost |
|---------|------|
| SMS | $0.025 per part |
| Email | $0.001 per email |

## How to Add Funds

### Promo Codes

If you have a promo code, redeem it for instant credits:

1. Go to the [Account](https://console.notifox.com/?view=account) tab
2. Enter your promo code
3. Click "Redeem"

Credits appear immediately in your balance.

### Credit/Debit Card

To add funds via card:

1. Go to the [Billing](https://console.notifox.com/?view=billing) tab
2. Add a payment method if you haven't already
3. Click a preset amount (**$5**, **$10**, **$25**, **$50**, **$100**) or enter a custom amount
4. Confirm the charge

Funds are added instantly after payment.

## Viewing Your Balance

Your balance appears in the top-left corner of the console and on the Billing page.

## Transaction History

View all account activity on the [Billing](https://console.notifox.com/?view=billing) tab under "Transaction History":

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Topup` | Funds added via payment |
| `Usage` | Credits used for alerts |
| `Promo` | Promo code credits |
| `Refund` | Refunded amounts |

## Next Steps
